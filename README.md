## About Me

I am a Software Engineer with a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems from the Federal University of Uberl√¢ndia (UFU) and currently pursuing a Master's in Data Science. My expertise includes developing impactful solutions using Python, C# .NET, and Go, particularly in cloud environments (AWS and Azure) and distributed systems.

I have a strong background in data science, having presented my undergraduate thesis at the 2024 Brazilian Symposium on Databases (SBBD), the leading Latin American event in Big Data and Data Engineering. Additionally, I have experience in process automation with Python bots, Machine Learning (ML), and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

As a former programming and robotics educator at UFU, I contributed to the development of young talent and published academic articles on educational robotics. I also have hands-on experience with embedded systems (ESP32, LoRa, Raspberry Pi) and database management (Oracle, SQL, MariaDB, MongoDB).

My technical skills include developing RESTful APIs, applying MVC and SOLID principles, and implementing innovative solutions in cloud and back-end environments.

I am eager to bring my expertise to international teams and am open to opportunities where I can contribute to impactful, cutting-edge projects.
