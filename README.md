## About Me

I am a **Software Engineer** with extensive experience in **backend development**, specializing in **Golang**, **distributed systems**, and **cloud-native solutions** (AWS & Azure). Over the years, I have designed and implemented **high-performance, scalable systems** for financial transactions, IoT, and energy monitoring, leveraging technologies like **Golang, C# .NET, Python, and cloud platforms (AWS, Azure)**.

My expertise includes building **RESTful APIs**, **microservices architectures**, and **event-driven systems**, with a strong focus on **resilience, low latency, and high availability**. I am passionate about **innovation, automation, and AI-driven solutions**, and I thrive in environments where I can collaborate with global teams to push the boundaries of technology.

Currently, I am seeking international opportunities to contribute to cutting-edge projects in **backend development, distributed systems, and cloud engineering**.
